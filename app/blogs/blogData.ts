    <p>
      For the longest time, humans have hoped to develop machines with human intelligence —
      essentially creating systems that can act and think like us. Computer Vision (CV)
      is one such technology where humans have tried to enable computers to interpret
      digital photographs and videos the way humans do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Computer Vision is one of the most powerful branches of Artificial Intelligence.
      It is a field of computer science that focuses on duplicating parts of the
      complexity of the human visual system. With rapid advancements in AI, deep learning,
      and neural networks, computer vision has progressed at an incredible pace.
    </p>

    <img src="/assets/blogs/computer/1.webp" alt="Computer Vision concept" />

    <h2>What is Computer Vision?</h2>

    <p>
      Computer Vision is a field of study focused on enabling computers to see and
      interpret visual content in a way similar to humans.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a multidisciplinary domain that falls under artificial intelligence and
      machine learning. It uses general learning algorithms along with specialized
      techniques to extract visual information from images and videos, analyze it,
      and make meaningful decisions using software algorithms.
    </p>

    <h2>What can Computer Vision do?</h2>

    <p>
      Computer Vision can be applied to a wide range of real-world tasks, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Object Identification</strong> — Identifying objects in images or videos, such as detecting a specific type of car.</li>
      <li><strong>Object Verification</strong> — Determining whether a particular object is present in a visual input.</li>
      <li><strong>Object Classification</strong> — Categorizing objects into predefined groups.</li>
      <li><strong>Object Tracking</strong> — Tracking one or more moving objects across video frames.</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="/assets/blogs/computer/2.webp" alt="Object detection and tracking" />

    <h2>How does Computer Vision work?</h2>

    <p>
      Computer Vision is inspired by the way the human brain processes visual information.
      One of the biggest challenges in both neuroscience and machine learning is
      understanding how the brain interprets what we see.
    </p>

    <p>
      The core hypothesis behind computer vision systems is that the human brain relies
      on patterns to decode objects. Similarly, computer vision algorithms are built on
      pattern recognition.
    </p>

    <p>
      Computers are trained on massive volumes of visual data. Images are broken down
      into pixels, where each pixel holds a numerical color value. The system processes
      these pixel values, labels objects, identifies patterns, and learns to recognize
      them accurately over time.
    </p>

    <h2>Computer Vision Applications</h2>

    <h3>Augmented and Mixed Reality</h3>

    <p>
      Computer vision enables devices to overlay virtual objects onto real-world imagery.
      Augmented Reality systems use computer vision to detect real-world surfaces such as
      floors, walls, and furniture, allowing virtual elements to be placed accurately.
    </p>

    <h3>Self-Driving Cars</h3>

    <p>
      Computer Vision plays a critical role in autonomous vehicles. Cameras capture
      real-time video from multiple angles and feed it into computer vision software.
      The system detects roads, traffic signs, vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles,
      allowing the car to navigate safely.
    </p>



    <h3>Facial Recognition</h3>

    <p>
      Facial recognition systems use computer vision algorithms to detect and analyze
      facial features in images. These features are compared against databases for
      authentication, social media tagging, and law enforcement applications.
    </p>

    <h3>3D Computer Vision</h3>

    <p>
      While traditional computer vision works with 2D images, 3D computer vision adds
      depth perception. It allows systems to understand spatial relationships and
      human activity, such as identifying whether a person is walking, standing, or
      performing an action.
    </p>

    <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>

    <p>
      Computer vision solutions are already transforming industries ranging from
      autonomous transportation to healthcare and agriculture. While progress has been
      remarkable, fully replicating human vision remains a complex challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      As computer vision continues to evolve and break new ground across industries,
      we can expect even greater innovation and adoption in the years to come.

  author: "Ascent Standard",

  html: `
    <blockquote>
      “The need for high-quality, trustworthy data in our world will never go away.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      While the above statement is true, it comes with its own set of challenges —
      starting with the collection of quality data.
    </p>

    <p>
      With exponential growth in data, the need for trust arises more than ever.
      Even though we have evolved from data silos to pipelines (ETL/ELT), streaming,
      modern data stacks, data warehouses, multi-cloud, and data mesh architectures,
      we are still faced with an age-old problem: <strong>trusting data</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      What data is good for which purpose? What data can be used where? How can it be
      improved? What data is sensitive?
    </p>

    <p>
      These questions remain unanswered despite decades of Data Management disciplines
      such as Data Governance, Data Quality, Data Observability, Data Catalog,
      Master Data Management, Data Remediation, Data Discovery, Active Metadata
      Management, Data Privacy, Data Intelligence, Data Lineage, Reference Data
      Management, and many more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Somewhere along the way, the original intent was lost — the objective of
      <strong>trusting data and improving it</strong>. Trust me, I am with you on this.
      If you don’t believe me, see my hand-drawn picture below.
    </p>

    <img src="/assets/blogs/noice/1.webp" alt="Noise in data quality" />

    <p>
      Whilst working with data, the deeper you look, the scarier it gets —
      and that’s a good sign.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the brave data professionals who practice all these disciplines and are still
      hanging in there, this is our effort to cut through the noise and highlight
      what truly matters in modern data quality.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Factors Creating Noise in Modern Data Quality</h2>

    <h3>Scale with Increase in Data (Scale)</h3>
    <p>
      As data volumes grow, platforms must scale to handle massive datasets,
      diverse data types, and multiple architectures. Speed and scale are critical,
      but equally important is the ability to scale using no-code or low-code
      approaches.
    </p>

    <h3>Each Organization Is Unique (Context)</h3>
    <p>
      Organizations differ even within the same industry, technology stack, or
      architecture. Processes, people, and customers define context.
      Without understanding this context, data solutions become meaningless.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the same income range can have completely different interpretations
      in marketing, risk analysis, or underwriting — same data, different meaning.
    </p>

    <h3>Supporting Organizational Evolution (Maturity)</h3>
    <p>
      Mergers and acquisitions introduce complexity. Platforms must support
      multiple maturity levels as organizations evolve, otherwise businesses
      end up replacing platforms every year — which simply does not work.
    </p>

    <h3>Relevance to Business Value (Impact)</h3>
    <p>
      Data quality efforts often focus too much on metrics and alerts while
      forgetting business value. Anomalies or outliers may actually be intentional
      business strategies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Excessive alerts, unnecessary root-cause analysis, and irrelevant notifications
      only create more noise. Data quality must align with strategic business goals.
    </p>

    <h3>Time to Value (Time & Cost)</h3>
    <p>
      Heavy governance frameworks with complex processes slow everything down.
      By the time implementation is complete, the data landscape has already changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Time to value should be measured in days — not weeks, months, or years.
    </p>

    <h3>Supporting All Users (Stewardship)</h3>
    <p>
      Organizations have both business users and technical users. Both must
      collaborate to improve data quality. Otherwise, silos and communication
      barriers only increase.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Accuracy</h2>

    <p>
      Data Accuracy is one of the commonly cited dimensions of Data Quality.
      It aims to measure how closely data represents reality.
    </p>

    <p>
      We define Data Accuracy as:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “The degree to which a data value represents what it purports to represent.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      One challenge is that there is no universal agreement on how Data Accuracy
      should be defined. More importantly, achieving 100% accuracy is impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Walter A. Shewhart observed that all measurement systems introduce error.
      W. Edwards Deming expanded on this by stating that there is
      <em>“no true value of anything.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since perfect accuracy is unattainable, the real question becomes:
      how inaccurate is the data?
    </p>

    <p>
      This cannot be answered by analyzing the data alone. Assessing Data Accuracy
      requires stepping outside the dataset, independently evaluating samples,
      and comparing observations with curated data.
    </p>

    <p>
      One exception exists when data itself represents reality — such as bank
      account balances in transactional systems. In such cases, data is not
      an observation but the reality itself.
    </p>

    <h2>What’s Next</h2>

    <p>
      Welcome to the Data Quality Series. In upcoming blogs, we will explore
      the challenges of each data discipline and practical ways to overcome them
      to achieve trusted, high-quality data.
    </p>

    <h2>Identify New Customers</h2>

    <p>
      To identify potential new customers, you must first understand who your
      customers are. This requires insight into key demographics.
    </p>

    <p>
      When evaluating your product or service, consider questions such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Who will use your product or service?</li>
      <li>What is the age range of your customers?</li>
      <li>What is their income level, marital status, and geographical location?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Market research enables businesses to answer these questions and target
      customers more effectively.
    </p>

    <h2>Get to Know Your Existing Customers</h2>

    <p>
      Understanding your existing customers is just as important as finding new ones.
      Asking the right questions can uncover valuable insights:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Why do customers choose your products over competitors?</li>
      <li>How do customers use your products?</li>
      <li>What challenges do your products solve?</li>
      <li>Who or what influences their purchasing decisions?</li>
      <li>What do your customers enjoy doing, watching, and reading?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Understanding customer behavior helps improve offerings and identify
      upselling and cross-selling opportunities.
    </p>

    <h2>Set Realistic Targets for Your Business</h2>

    <p>
      With insights into both target and existing customers, businesses can set
      realistic and achievable goals for continuous improvement and growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being customer-centric is essential in today’s business environment.
      One of the most effective frameworks used in market research is the
      <strong>STP Model</strong>:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Segmentation</strong> — Identifying groups based on demographics, location, or behavior.</li>
      <li><strong>Targeting</strong> — Reaching the segments most aligned with your offering.</li>
      <li><strong>Positioning</strong> — Differentiating your brand from competitors in the minds of your audience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Develop New and Effective Strategies</h2>

    <p>
      Market research provides data-driven insights that support better decision-making.
      These insights help with pricing strategies, distribution channels, marketing
      communications, and identifying opportunities for new products or services.
    </p>

    <p>
      Businesses can answer critical questions such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Should we expand or reduce operations?</li>
      <li>Is there room to diversify our offerings?</li>
      <li>Are we targeting the right audience with our marketing efforts?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For example, Casio leveraged market research to gain deeper insights into
      customers and resellers, allowing the brand to refine and optimize its
      marketing strategies.
    </p>

    <h2>Solve Your Biggest Business Challenges</h2>

    <p>
      When a business faces challenges, market research helps identify the root cause.
      It can determine whether a new competitor has entered the market, brand awareness
      has declined, or customer preferences have shifted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Various types of market research — including brand research, consumer research,
      usability testing, and product development studies — help uncover gaps and
      opportunities.
    </p>

    <h2>Investigate Expansion Opportunities</h2>

    <p>
      Market research enables businesses to evaluate potential expansion opportunities
      by testing markets before committing resources. It can also help identify the
      most suitable locations for opening new offices or stores.
    </p>

    <h2>Identify How to Expand Your Offering</h2>

    <p>
      Research can uncover under-served markets and emerging trends driven by
      demographic shifts, urban development, education levels, or changing consumer
      expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
      These insights allow businesses to adapt offerings and stay ahead of demand.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      Market research is not limited to startups alone. Businesses of all sizes,
      industries, and experience levels benefit from understanding customers,
      identifying issues, solving problems, and discovering new growth opportunities.

    <blockquote>
      “Data is the new oil. It’s valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used.
      It has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc. to create a valuable
      entity that drives profitable activity; so must data be broken down, analyzed
      for it to have value.”
      <span>— Clive Humby, 2006</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Clive Humby, a British mathematician and data science entrepreneur, originally
      coined the phrase <em>“data is the new oil.”</em> Since then, the idea has been
      echoed and expanded upon by many thought leaders across industries.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Information is the oil of the 21st century, and analytics is the combustion engine.”
      <span>— Peter Sondergaard, 2011</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Data can be described as raw information about a variable or entity. It can be
      anything that can be captured, stored, and processed — from small datasets to
      massive volumes stored across cloud platforms such as Azure and other
      distributed systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data is valuable across industries including business, education, information
      technology, and data science. It forms the foundation of analytics and artificial
      intelligence, serving as the raw material upon which insights and predictions
      are built.
    </p>

    <p>
      While there may be undiscovered oil reserves in the world, oil is ultimately a
      finite resource. In contrast, data is practically infinite.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2019 alone, the United States consumed an average of 20.54 million barrels of
      petroleum per day. Meanwhile, as early as 2018, it was estimated that
      <strong>2.5 quintillion bytes of data</strong> were being generated globally
      every single day.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the number of internet users growing exponentially, it is safe to say that
      data will never truly run out. In fact, we will continue generating more data
      indefinitely.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another key distinction between oil and data lies in consumption. Oil, once used
      as fuel, is consumed and destroyed. Data, on the other hand, is not destroyed
      when used for analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the information age, everyday human actions continuously generate data.
      Consider the following examples:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Creating a Facebook profile generates personal and behavioral data.</li>
      <li>Accepting a friend request contributes to social graph data.</li>
      <li>Watching a movie on Netflix feeds recommendation algorithms.</li>
      <li>Purchasing a product on Amazon informs personalized recommendations.</li>
      <li>Searching on Google creates searchable intent data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Data is an asset that does not lose value after use. Technology companies can
      collect and analyze customer behavior data over years to build increasingly
      sophisticated models.
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine how refined Amazon’s recommendation engine could become after another
      decade of learning from online shopping behavior. By continuously updating
      algorithms with fresh data, organizations can transform data into a long-term
      value-generating asset.
    </p>

    <p>
      The effectiveness of analytics and AI solutions depends heavily on the quality
      of the data used. High-quality data produces reliable insights, while low-quality
      data leads to poor or misleading results.
    </p>

    <p>
      If raw data contains missing or inaccurate information, it must be refined
      before being used for analytics. Unlike oil, where more fuel does not
      necessarily improve engine performance, more data has the potential to create
      more accurate and robust predictive models.
    </p>

    <p>
      Systems that allow organizations to continuously collect, store, and refine
      data enable businesses to turn information into a strategic asset that
      compounds in value over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the 21st century, data is not just the new oil — it is the fuel that powers
      intelligent decision-making, innovation, and sustainable growth.
